## **IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN**

### **Quick Implementation (8-12 hours total)**

**Priority 1: Analysis API (3-4 hours)**
```python
# Create these files:
apps/analysis/serializers.py    # Analysis CRUD operations
apps/analysis/views.py          # ViewSet implementation  
apps/analysis/urls.py           # URL routing
```

**Priority 2: Basic ML Service (4-5 hours)**
```python
# Create ML inference service:
apps/analysis/ml_service.py     # Model loading & inference
apps/analysis/preprocessing.py  # Image preprocessing
# Add simple segmentation model (dummy or pre-trained)
```

**Priority 3: Results Frontend (3-4 hours)**  
```jsx
# Complete results visualization:
pages/ResultsPage.jsx           # Main results interface
components/SegmentationViewer.jsx  # Image + mask overlay
components/MetricsDisplay.jsx   # Analysis metrics charts
```

### **Expected Outcome**
After completing these 3 priorities:
- **100% functional demo** for interviews
