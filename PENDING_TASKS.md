# MedScan Platform - Current Development Status

Report updated: 2025-01-21

---

## EXTREME RISKS (Critical)

- PHI exposure via S3 (settings.py USE_S3): AWS_DEFAULT_ACL=public-read and public MEDIA_URL. Action: make bucket private, remove public-read, use presigned URLs, enable SSE (KMS), least-privilege IAM.
  Owner: Security/DevOps (@paulkokos)
  Deadline: 2025-10-16
- Missing core pipeline: Analysis views/serializers + ML inference absent → no E2E flow. Action: implement minimal Analysis API and inference service before any release.
  Owner: Backend/ML (@paulkokos)
  Deadline: 2025-10-20
- docker-compose: Postgres exposed (5432:5432) with weak creds medscan/medscan. Action: remove port mapping in prod, use secrets manager, strong passwords, network isolation.
  Owner: DevOps (@paulkokos)
  Deadline: 2025-10-16
- README references docker-compose.prod.yml which is missing. Action: add prod compose (no bind mounts, no dev flags) or fix docs.
  Owner: DevOps/Docs (@paulkokos)
  Deadline: 2025-10-17
- Insecure defaults: SECRET_KEY/JWT fallbacks and DEBUG toggles. Action: enforce non-default env vars at startup; fail fast if missing.
  Owner: Backend (@paulkokos)
  Deadline: 2025-10-16
- Logging PII risk: logs/django.log may capture sensitive data. Action: scrub sensitive fields, lower log level, rotate/secure logs, avoid request bodies in prod.
  Owner: Backend (@paulkokos)
  Deadline: 2025-10-18
- Backend Dockerfile healthcheck uses python -c import requests and /admin. Action: use curl/wget to a lightweight /health endpoint; ensure dependency exists.
  Owner: DevOps (@paulkokos)
  Deadline: 2025-10-17
- HTTPS/CORS hardening: enforce HTTPS end-to-end, strict CORS allowlist, secure cookies, verify HSTS behind reverse proxy.
  Owner: Backend/DevOps (@paulkokos)
  Deadline: 2025-10-19
- Compliance/data retention: do not store raw medical images without BAA/DPA; document anonymization policy and retention/erasure.
  Owner: Security/Compliance (@paulkokos)
  Deadline: 2025-10-23
- Repo hygiene: backend/.env and db.sqlite3 exist locally; ensure not committed; confirm .gitignore, rotate any leaked secrets.
  Owner: Maintainers/DevOps (@paulkokos)
  Deadline: 2025-10-14
- Auth hardening missing: rate limiting/brute-force protection and optional 2FA. Action: enable DRF throttling/django-ratelimit; plan 2FA.
  Owner: Backend/Security (@paulkokos)
  Deadline: 2025-10-20
