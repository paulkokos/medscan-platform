# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities in the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.1   | :x:                |

**Note:** As this project is in early development (Alpha), security updates will be applied to the latest version only.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of MedScan Platform seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via one of the following methods:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (Preferred)
   - Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/paulkokos/medscan-platform/security/advisories)
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the form with details

2. **GitHub Issues** (For non-critical issues)
   - Create a private security advisory issue
   - Tag with "security" label

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Description** - A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact** - What can be achieved by exploiting the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce** - Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Affected Versions** - Which versions are affected
- **Proof of Concept** - Code or screenshots demonstrating the vulnerability
- **Suggested Fix** - If you have ideas on how to fix it (optional)

### Example Report Format

```
Subject: SECURITY - SQL Injection in Image Upload

Description:
An SQL injection vulnerability exists in the image upload endpoint that allows
authenticated users to execute arbitrary SQL queries.

Affected Component:
- File: backend/apps/images/views.py
- Function: ImageViewSet.create()
- Line: 45

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log in as a regular user
2. POST to /api/images/ with the following payload:
   {
     "title": "test'; DROP TABLE images; --",
     "file": [file]
   }
3. The SQL query is executed without sanitization

Impact:
- Database manipulation
- Data exfiltration
- Potential data loss

Affected Versions:
- v0.1.0 and earlier

Proof of Concept:
[Attach screenshots or code]

Suggested Fix:
Use Django ORM's parameterized queries instead of raw SQL.
```

## Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports according to the following timeline:

| Stage | Timeline |
|-------|----------|
| Initial Response | Within 48 hours |
| Assessment | Within 7 days |
| Fix Development | Within 30 days (depends on severity) |
| Public Disclosure | After fix is released |

### Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment** (48 hours)
   - We will acknowledge receipt of your report
   - We will assign a tracking ID

2. **Assessment** (7 days)
   - We will investigate and assess the severity
   - We will confirm if the vulnerability is valid
   - We will provide an estimated fix timeline

3. **Development** (varies by severity)
   - Critical: 7 days
   - High: 14 days
   - Medium: 30 days
   - Low: 60 days

4. **Release**
   - We will develop and test the fix
   - We will release a security patch
   - We will notify you before public disclosure

5. **Disclosure**
   - We will publish a security advisory
   - We will credit you (if desired)
   - We will update the changelog

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Authentication
- Use strong, unique passwords (minimum 12 characters)
- Enable two-factor authentication when available
- Never share your credentials
- Log out when using shared computers

#### API Keys
- Keep API keys confidential
- Rotate keys regularly
- Use environment variables, never commit keys to code
- Revoke unused keys immediately

#### Data Protection
- Only upload de-identified medical images
- Comply with HIPAA and GDPR regulations
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Regular security audits of your deployment

### For Developers

#### Input Validation
```python
# Good - Always validate and sanitize input
from django.core.validators import validate_email

def register_user(email, password):
    validate_email(email)  # Validate email format
    if len(password) < 12:
        raise ValueError("Password too short")
    # Continue with registration
```

#### SQL Injection Prevention
```python
# Good - Use ORM or parameterized queries
User.objects.filter(email=user_email)

# Bad - Never use string formatting for queries
cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '{user_email}'")
```

#### XSS Prevention
```javascript
// Good - Use React's built-in escaping
<div>{userInput}</div>

// Bad - Dangerous HTML injection
<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: userInput}} />
```

#### CSRF Protection
```python
# Good - Django's CSRF protection is enabled by default
from django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf_protect

@csrf_protect
def my_view(request):
    # View logic
```

#### Secrets Management
```python
# Good - Use environment variables
import os
SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')

# Bad - Never hardcode secrets
SECRET_KEY = 'my-secret-key-123'
```

#### Dependency Management
```bash
# Regularly check for vulnerabilities
npm audit
pip check
safety check
```
